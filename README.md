# Library Management System

Contributors: William Tomah
Languages: Python
Frameworks: Pandas


## Description
A Library Management System coded in Python. User will log in and have access to a database of available books. After searching for the books, the user will have the option to check out book(s).

Admin will have access to database and make changes to books in the database and the quantity of the books. Admin will also have access to who has checked out book(s) and it was checked out.

Current Progress: The program allows login access for admin and user menus. Both menus don't have all options ready. I have imported a database via Pandas and this database for the books in the library.
